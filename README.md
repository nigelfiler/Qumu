## üîπ `QC_BulkUpload.html`

**Purpose:**  
Bulk upload multiple videos to your Qumu instance.

**Key Features:**
- Automatically uses the original filename as the Qumu Presentation title, with option to add prefix (eg "BULK")
- Streamlines the upload process for batches of media files.
- Drag and drop video files onto the UI to start the process
- Works with Presentation Types that have custom metadata fields, including mandatory fields
- Provides CSV download of uploaded video

**Important Notes:**
Do not use Presentation Types that have **Creators Choice from All** in the workflow where there is no default defined. These will publish to **Draft** status and require manual processing to complete.

Approval workflows will require manual approval.
