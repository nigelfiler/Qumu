**Purpose:**  
Bulk upload multiple videos to your Qumu instance.

**Key Features:**
- Automatically uses the original filename as the Qumu Presentation title.
- Streamlines the upload process for batches of media files.
- Drag and drop video files onto the UI to start the process

**Important Notes:**
- Do not use Presentation Types that:
