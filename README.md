## üîπ `QC_Bulk_Video_Upload.html`

**Purpose:**  
Bulk upload multiple videos to your Qumu instance. Supports 10 videos at a time to limit API requests.

[**Screenshot**](./Screenshots/Bulk_Upload.png)

**Key Features:**
- Automatically uses the original filename as the Qumu Presentation title, with option to add prefix (eg "BULK").
- Streamlines the upload process for batches of media files.
- Drag and drop video files onto the UI to start the process.
- Works with Presentation Types that have custom metadata fields, including mandatory fields.
- Provides CSV report download of the uploaded videos.

**Important Notes:**

Do not use Presentation Types that have **Creators Choice from All** in the workflow where there is no default defined. These will publish to **Draft** status and require manual processing to complete.

Video uploaded using Presentation Types with Approval workflows will have **STATUS: PENDING_APPROVAL** and require the usual approval by the designated approver.

## üîπ `QC_Single_Video_Upload.html`

**Purpose:**  
Upload a **single video** to your Qumu instance.

**Use Case:**  
Can be used as sample code for integrating video uploads into platforms such as **WordPress** or other CMS solutions.
Works with Presentation Types that have custom metadata.

**Important Notes:**

Do not use Presentation Types that have **Creators Choice from All** in the workflow where there is no default defined. These will publish to **Draft** status and require manual processing to complete.

Video uploaded using Presentation Types with Approval workflows will have **STATUS: PENDING_APPROVAL** and require the usual approval by the designated approver

## üîπ `QC_Duplicate_User_Search.html`

**Purpose:**  
Searches all users within the instance and shows possible duplicate users, eg users that may have a local account and also a SAML account, or same name but different email address.<br/>
The results table can be searched and also filtered by duplicates. A report may be downloaded for further analysis.<br/>
This utility uses Levenshtein distance‚Äìbased fuzzy matching algorithm and the user can select Strict, Balanced or Loose in the search criteria.<br/> Loose will find more, but also generate false positives.

**Important Notes:**
Has not been tested with very large datasets, but for datasets over 10,000 users the results will only show duplicates by default.
