## 🔹 `QC_BulkUpload.html`

**Purpose:**  
Bulk upload multiple videos to your Qumu instance. Supports 10 videos at a time to limit API requests. 

**Key Features:**
- Automatically uses the original filename as the Qumu Presentation title, with option to add prefix (eg "BULK").
- Streamlines the upload process for batches of media files.
- Drag and drop video files onto the UI to start the process.
- Works with Presentation Types that have custom metadata fields, including mandatory fields.
- Provides CSV report download of the uploaded videos.

**Important Notes:**

Do not use Presentation Types that have **Creators Choice from All** in the workflow where there is no default defined. These will publish to **Draft** status and require manual processing to complete.

Video uploaded using Presentation Types with Approval workflows will have **STATUS: PENDING_APPROVAL** and require manual processing by the designated approver.
